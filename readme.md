# React Native Booster
## Propulse your React Native application with a minimal template.
# This is a WORK IN PROGRESS
This template is currently a work in progress and might see heavy modifications. However, the master branch is always a working application, you can safely pull the repo and start coding your app.

## Goal
The goal is to provide a minimal template for React Native applications in TypeScript. The template is meant to be as minimal as possible, just enough to kick start your application without having to write boilerplate code.

By using a very small set of features, this template aims to be easy to update so that latest packages are always in use.

### Differences with existing templates/boilerplates
In this template you will not find any complex store or navigation configurations. The minimal boilerplate code sufficient for an application to run is offered, but any additional functionality has to be added by the developer. Most boilerplates offer a complex ecosystem but developer ends up using only a small fraction of it (especially for small applications), this template tries to avoid that.
